Game Mechanics
1. Game Objectives
Protect the Core Target: Each level has a core target. Enemies will move along fixed paths, attempting to approach and attack the core target. Players need to place defense towers along the paths to eliminate the enemies. If all enemies are defeated and the core target remains unharmed, the level is cleared. If the core target is damaged beyond a certain threshold, the game fails.

2. Defense Tower System
Various Tower Types: Defense towers come in different types, such as:

Single Attack Tower: Deals high damage to a single enemy.
Area Attack Tower: Deals damage to enemies within a certain area.
Slowdown Tower: Reduces the movement speed of enemies.
Special Function Tower: Includes effects like stunning or poison damage.
Upgrade System: Defense towers can be upgraded using gold coins. Upgrades enhance attributes such as attack power, range, or special abilities.

3. Level Mechanics
Enemy Waves: Enemies appear in waves, with each wave possibly featuring different types or numbers of enemies.
Fixed Paths: Enemies follow specific paths, and players must strategically place towers at key locations.
Map Obstacles: Some maps contain obstacles that must be destroyed before towers can be built. Destroying obstacles may also drop gold coins or hidden items.

4. Resource Management
Gold Coins: Gold coins are required to build and upgrade defense towers. They can be obtained by defeating enemies or destroying obstacles.
Items: Certain levels provide items (e.g., bombs, slowing traps) to assist players in defense.

5. Enemy Types
Enemies vary in type, and different strategies are needed to counter specific enemy types effectively.

6. Level Design
The game consists of multiple levels and themed environments (e.g., deserts, icy landscapes, forests), each with unique terrain and challenges. As levels progress, enemies grow stronger, requiring players to adapt their strategies.

7. Strategy and Challenges
Players need to design optimal tower placements based on enemy characteristics and paths, allocate resources wisely, and decide which towers to upgrade first to overcome challenges.
